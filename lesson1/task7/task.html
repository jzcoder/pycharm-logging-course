We mentioned in a previous task, there are 5 severity levels : CRITICAL, ERROR, INFO, WARNING, DEBUG.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few exceptions.  First, a few of the levels have several constants defined.

FATAL can be used instead of CRITICAL.  There is also a fatal() helper method for this level. Both CRITICAL and
FATAL share the same numeric log level of 50. They can be used interchangeably.
<br/>
<br/>
WARN can also be used as a shortcut for WARNING. They mean the same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTSET is a special constant that represents the lowest possible log severity level. It has a value of 0. You should
not log messages with this severity level. It is used when configuring loggers in the logging hierarchy.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, replace the logging level passed to basicConfig() with NOTSET.  You will notice the output is
similar to DEBUG, since NOTSET is a lower level (0) it includes every level.
