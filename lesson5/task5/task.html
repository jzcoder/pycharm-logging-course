In a previous task, we showed adding a filter to a Logger object. Since, filters are only applied when the log
method is called on a Logger, the filter has to be added to every logger that needs to have the filter applied. You
can also add a filter to a Handler, and since the log records propagate up the hierarchy, the filter will be applied
by the handler for all log records that reach it.

In this task, add the filter to all the handlers on the root logger.
