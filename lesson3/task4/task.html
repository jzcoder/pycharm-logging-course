In the previous task, you may have noticed the only thing output in our log file was the log message.
<br/>
<br/>
This is because we have no Formatter object set on our handler. In previous examples, we have relied
on "basicConfig()" to build a formatter for us.
<br/>
<br/>
The Formatter is responsible for taking a LogRecord object and creating a string result that can be used
by the Handler to output a log message. Each Handler has one Formatter.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task we need to construct a "Formatter" object, passing it our format string. Then we need
to call "setHandler" on our new file handler instance.

Note: To see the file "file_handler_with_formatter.log" in your Sandbox, you may have to collapse/expand the "Sandbox" folder in your Project view to
see the new file created.
