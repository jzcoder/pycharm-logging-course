If you are calling an expensive function and passing the result to a logging statement, you may want to prevent
that function from being called unless the current logging level is going to output the log message.
<br/>
<br/>
This can be done by checking the return value from "isEnabledFor()" on the Logger object. This function takes
the logging level, and if the logger is going to output the message, the return value is True.
<br/>
<br/>
In this example, the root logger level is set to WARNING. We output a debug level log message, passing in the
result of calculate_expensive_result().  This code executes, even though the debug level message is being filtered out.
 <br/>
<br/>
Add a conditional statement to not log this message if the log level will not apply to the handler.
