One thing you should be aware of when working with more advanced handlers, is how the logging system gracefully
closes and cleans up any resources it is using. For example, if a handler is buffering log messages such as
the MemoryHandler, then how does the logging system ensure those messages are handled.
<br/>
<br/>
This is done through the "logging.shutdown()" function. The logging module will automatically register this function
to be called when the interpreter is shutting down. So, normally you shouldn't have to worry about it. However, there
are some cases where you might want to explicitly shutdown your handlers. For example, if you are debugging your
handlers "close()" method or the handler is using some resources that may be uninitialized by the time
the close() method is called.

In this task, insert the call to explicitly shutdown the logging system.
