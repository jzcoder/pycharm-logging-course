In the previous task, we started new log files based on the file size. In some cases, it's useful to start a new
log file after a specified time interval. When you are given a problem to diagnose at a specific time, it is easier
to determine which log file contains the log information based on the filename.
<br/>
<br/>
TimedRotatingFileHandler is similar to RotatingFileHandler() except you specify two interval parameters. The first
argument "when" specifies the type of interval. Here are possible values (case insensitive):
<br/>
<pre>
VALUE          TYPE OF INTERVAL
=============+======================'
'S'          | Seconds
'M'          | Minutes
'H'          | Hours
'D'          | Days
'W0'-'W6'    | Weekday (0=Monday)
'midnight'   | Roll over at midnight
</pre>
The second argument is "interval" which is going to depend on the type of interval. Using a "when" value of "H" and
an "interval" of "1" is going to roll over the log file every one hour.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, we have created a special filter that causes a delay between log records. This is to help demonstrate
the rolling over behavior using time.
<br/>
<br/>
Update the arguments to TimedRotatingFileHandler to rotate the log file every two seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
After you execute this task, wait about 20 seconds, then look at the Sandbox folder for the "timed_rotation.log" files. You should note how
the filename also has a date/time appended to it.
