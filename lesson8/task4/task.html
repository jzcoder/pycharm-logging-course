You should typically not configure any logging handlers if you are writing a library. It is quite obnoxious for
a library developer to do this, since it should be under the control of the developer using your library.

<br/>
If you are the developer of the library, then configure your logging handlers in a test application instead.

Let's assume in this task, this is a library module. It explicitly creates a FileHandler and adds it to the module's
logger at file scope. This is "NOT" a good practice.  Let's at least replace this using the NullHandler, which
will not write the logs anywhere.  If the library user wants to log somewhere, he can do that himself at the
application level.
