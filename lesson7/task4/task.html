This task demonstrates how you can use a Filter to inject attributes into a LogRecord,
and then format those attributes using a Formatter. This can be done in the Filter's "filter()" method, which
is passed the "record" object containing the log attributes.

This task also demonstrates how a Filter() can be configured using dictConfig(),
something that is not possible using fileConfig().  In this example,
the class name is specified directly in Python code.

In this task, we have defined a "LogUserInjector" filter class. It exposes a public method "set_userid()" that can be
called to set the current user ID. It stores this value in thread local storage, so each thread of execution can
maintain a unique value while the thread is running, or until the next call to set the user ID. As log messages in the thread
are logged, they are passed to our filter. The filter reads the user ID from thread local storage and injects
this value into the LogRecord. We also added "%(user_id)s" to our formatting string, so every log message will
contain this attribute.
