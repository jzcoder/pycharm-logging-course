Writing your log messages out as structured JSON objects allows you to write programs to easily process your logs.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, we have created a new object called JSONFormatter that inherits from Formatter. The most important
method to implement is the "format()" method which returns a string to be passed to a Handler.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, add the call to set this new formatter on the StreamHandler instance.
