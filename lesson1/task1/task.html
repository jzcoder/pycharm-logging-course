The following code is typical of how many people start debugging their programs using the "print" function.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with using "print" to output debugging information, is it does not work well in
larger programs. The debug output interferes with application output and you typically end up commenting out or
removing all this extra code when you are not debugging.
<br/>
<br/>
The standard logging module provides an easy way to separate application output from debug output.

<br/>
In this task, replace the highlighted "print" function calls with calls to "logging.debug".
