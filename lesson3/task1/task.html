Up to this point we have been outputting our logging information to stderr (console) output. This is useful for
small programs, but as the amount of log output increases, it is useful to log the output to a file, so that you
can go back and search the output for specific information.
<br/>
<br/>
The logging module allows us to setup Handler objects to write the output to different destinations. The FileHandler
is a built-in Handler object that writes log output to a file.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task we can use the "basicConfig()" function to setup a FileHandler for us automatically. This is done by
passing the "filename" keyword argument. Use the value of log_filename. The FileHandler created
is automatically added to the root logger.

<br/>
After you successfully run this program, you should see a "basic_file.log" appear under the "Sandbox" folder
in the Project view.  The Sandbox should appear at the end of your project tree. You can double-click this
to see the contents. If the file does not appear, you can try collapsing and expanding the Sandbox folder.
You should also note that nothing was logged
to the console, because we replaced the default "stderr" stream handler with a FileHandler.
<br/>

If you run this task several times, you will notice the log messages are appended to the existing file every
time we run the program. This is because the default file mode is to append to the log file.
