In a previous lesson we demonstrated the MemoryHandler class. This handler buffers log records and sends them
to another handler after a specified number of records or a specified severity level is received.
<br/>
<br/>
With one small change we can make a smarter version of this handler that only writes to another handler when an ERROR or
higher message is logged. We could run our root logger at the DEBUG level, but instead of writing these to a file
after a specified capacity is reached, we discard the oldest records until an ERROR or higher level log message.
<br/>
<br/>
You can see how we implemented this in the shouldFlush() method of our SmartMemoryHandler.
<br/>
<br/>
For this task, create a new instance of our SmartMemoryHandler using the same options as we used for our MemoryHandler.
You can see this commented out above the answer placeholder.
<br/>
<br/>
After you execute this code, you can load the file "smart_memory_handler.log" located under the Sandbox folder. Collapse
and Expand this folder to ensure the file listing is refreshed. In this file you can see that there are only 2 log
messages (as we specified). Only the most recent DEBUG message was included in the output. You can see how in this
example this has given us enough information to help troubleshoot the exception.
