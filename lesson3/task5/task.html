We have replaced the console (stderr) handler with the file handler. Sometimes, it's useful to log to both
places at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
You can call "addHandler()" on a Logger multiple times. All of the Handler objects will receive the log messages.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, we have created a new StreamHandler instance. Instead of using "stderr" stream, you should
pass "sys.stdout" to see how you could use another output stream.  Then pass this StreamHandler instance to
"addHandler()".
<br/>
<br/>
You should also not forget to add the Formatter to the StreamHandler object. In this task, re-use the same Formatter
you used with the FileHandler. You should also note you can specify different formatters for each handler.
