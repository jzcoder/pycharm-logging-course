Logging configuration can also be specified as a Python dictionary. This makes
it very easy to store configuration in an external JSON or YAML file, since parsers
for those formats can return a native Python dict.
<br/>
<br/>
There are four important keys with dictConfig. The first three are the same
as in fileConfig(): "handlers", "formatters", "loggers".  The fourth is
a mandatory "version" key which at this time must be the integer value "1".
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, you can see the structure of this dictionary in the "log_config" variable. The root logger is designated with an empty string '',
under the "loggers" key. And under that key, you can see a "handlers" key which points to the name of an object
defined under the "handlers" section. This is an array of handler keys, since we can have multiple handlers attached
to a logger instance.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Set the proper handler in the root logger
<br/>
2) Pass the logging configuration to dictConfig()
<br/>

After you execute this task, you will only see the last WARNING message. We will explain this in the next task.
