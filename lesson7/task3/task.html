The standard library does not include a database handler for storing log messages in a database. The Python logging
system is easy to extend with our own database logging. Having log data in a database is useful for writing queries
and reports against your log data.
<br/>
<br/>
In this example, we have created a SQLite database handler. Since, the SQLite
database module is included in the standard library, you don't have to
install any databases.
<br/>
<br/>
This custom handler will attempt to create the database table named 'logger' with
the necessary schema to store most of the LogRecord attributes.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Handler's emit() method we will insert the LogRecord data into the table.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the task we write several queries to the database.
