A handler can be removed from a logger using the Logger's removeHandler().
<br/>
<br/>
At some point in your life with the logging module, you will encounter a problem
with duplicate log messages. The likely cause is an extra handler was inserted
somewhere in your logger hierarchy. Since log messages are sent up the
hierarchy to each handler, you can get the same output duplicated. One extremely
useful module to use in debugging problems like this is the "logging_tree"
module by Brandon Rhodes. I encourage you to try this module after this course.

<br/>
In this code, we are simulating two stream handlers that have been added to
our logging hierarchy.
<br/>
<br/>
Add the necessary code to leave the root handler, but remove all the handlers
from the "A.B" logger. Since, removeHandler() takes a handler object, we
have to get the handler from the handlers attribute on the Logger.
