When you include an object in your log message, the object's __str__ method is called to return a string value for that object.
<br/>
<br/>
If you run this task, you will notice the log message contains the __str__ generated string.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use the __repr__ generated string, you will have to explicitly call repr() on your object.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, log the __repr__ generated string.
