In the previous task, we used the "%(asctime)s" format specifier to print a human readable datetime string.
<br/>
<br/>
We can further customize the date/time output with the "datefmt" keyword argument in
the call to "basicConfig()".  The value is a "strftime" compatible format string.
<br/>
<br/>
In this task, pass a "datefmt" string value that would print a date time looking like "Sun Feb 22 2015 09:33:25PM".
<br/>
Here's an example of some of the strftime() codes that can be used to create such a format string.
