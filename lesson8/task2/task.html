Most of our Logger instances have been defined at module scope. This is certainly the most convenient way to use
logging, but in some cases you want to have more control over loggers. You can defer creating a logger instance
until it's actually needed.
<br/>
<br/>
In this example, we show how to create a private logger instance in the class constructor. We use the name of the
current module and append the class name. This will allow us to enable selective logging on just the output from
the class.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Complete the name of the FirstClass logger instance
<br/>
2) Set the instance logger level to DEBUG
<br/>
<br/>
You should not see any DEBUG output, except the log messages coming from the FirstClass object.
